1. If URL of webview changes, will application load content from new URL?

- Yes, I will reload a Content from new URL.


2. We would like to have a link in webview, that will open some native screen in application. Is it possible? How would you do it?

- You can set WebViewClient to WebView, after that override the 'shouldOverrideUrlLoading' method, then you can set some action to open a new Screen in this method by tag it with the url. 

For example:

@Override
public boolean shouldOverrideUrlLoading(WebView view, String url) {

//In this case, Not only the Activity can be opened
//but you can also show some dialog in here. 
        if (url.equals(TAG_CUSTOMER_ACTIVITY)) {
            Intent intent = new Intent(context, CustomerActivity);
            startActivity(intent);
            return true;
        } 
        else
            view.loadUrl(url);
            return false;
